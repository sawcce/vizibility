# Vizibility

Vizibility (of the viz family), aims to be an easy to pick-up, statically typed and compiled programming language built on top of the llvm compiler.

Vizibility uses a mix of rust and lua for it's syntax, combining versatility and readability.

```lua
fn main()
    println("Hello world!")
end
